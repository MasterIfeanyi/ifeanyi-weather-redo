# Getting started
## Description

This is a simple web app that allows users to see the current weather in different geographical locations.

I utilized the API [open weathermap](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather). 
## React

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app. `npx create-react-app . `

## Project Set-up

The dependencies required are all included in the `package.json` file. They will all be installed by running the `npm install` command.

To start the project run `npm start`.
